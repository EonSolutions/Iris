# Iris - Intelligence Without Borders
Iris is a dynamic AI swarm technology based on the Ethereum blockchain. We leverage decentralized infrastructure to empower anyone to create their own AI nodes, agents, or tools â€” each with unique capabilities, knowledge, or API access. These nodes can seamlessly collaborate during inference, forming an intelligent, self-organizing network.

## Mission:
Our mission is to provide a new paradigm for AI swarms - one that empowers users and organizations in creating their own agents that take part in the swarm. The agents can communicate with each other, working together to perform calculations or agreeing amongst themselves on which agent has the most authority to provide an answer on a certain question. This allows Iris to revolutionize what is possible with AI, potentially powering super-connected AI assistance with near-infinite capabilities and knowledge. 

## Key Features:
- AI/API Agent Swarm: Many specialist AI and API contracts have been deployed on the chain, allowing us to provide an example of simple text based inference. 
- Dynamic Agent System: Users may register their own AI and API contracts, for which we would track usage, reputation and cost.
- Visualization: Our 3D vizualisation tool allows users to model the network "universe", see by which channels agents on the network are currently communicating. 
  
## How does Iris Work?
Iris is based on ETH smart contracts written in solidity. Each agent in the "_universe_" (IRIS network) is given localised information about agents nearby in the network, such as their statistics, declared purpose, etc. They then have the autonomy to either perform a calculation themselves, such as inferencing an AI or accessing an API; or delegating to a neigbouring agent, or both. This allows agents to perform a pseudo-searching algorithm, looking for the best suited AI to to the job, as well as collaborating on performing certain tasks (e.g. `if the weather is nice today, order me a coffee`). Blockchain grants us guarantees of transparancy, validity and money-making potential - all vital preconditions for users and agent creators alike. 

## Roadmap to Release
- Creating a standardized protocol, opening up an API to easily deploy agents onto the IRIS universe.
- Multimodal input/output, with potential for fully autonomous agents.
- Implementing a fair reward / payment system for API utilisation. 

## Example Potential
- A personal assistant (e.g. _Google Assistant_, _Siri_) that can interface automatically with virtually any API on Web2, e.g. booking concert tickets, ordering a coffee, checking football scores.
- Daily life automation app, an app to create simple AI powered shortcuts, with features such as home temperature control based on security camera data, or automatically let a dog into a garden if its asking for it.
- Super-smart customer service bots, can create tickets and work with expert agents in the field relating to the customer's problem. 

## Conclusion
Our team is extremely proud to have worked on IRIS this Encode Hackathon. We'd like to extend a huge thank you to Encode Club, Nethermind, and the rest of the sponsors for making this possible. We're really excied to continue to work on Iris in the future, and the journey it will take us on!
